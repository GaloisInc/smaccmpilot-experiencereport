\subsection{Type-Check When You Cannot Interpret}

\todo{C (or really any low-level lang) has no interpreter.  Really long
  compile-debug loop.  Building an interpreter is impractical (i.e., modeling
  HW, etc.), so do the next-best thing: type-check.  Give some examples with
  Ivory/Tower.  cool things: safe drivers as easy as safe user-code.}
