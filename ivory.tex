\section{Ivory: Safe C Programming}
\label{sec:ivory}

At face value, our approach sounds audacious if not ludicrous: faced with a
deadline for developing a new high-assurance autopilot system in one-and-a-half
years, start by designing a new programming language and compiler from the
ground up.

Of course, developing an EDSL is not the same as developing a stand-alone
compiler.  Much of the typical compiler tool-chain, such as the front-end
parser/lexer, is provided for free by the host language.  Furthermore, we were
confident that time spent in writing the EDSL would be made up by developing in
a high-level functional language with a rich set of existing libraries. It took
approximately 6 engineer-months to create the language and compiler, and
total of about 6k lines of Haskell code.

The language we developed for generating safe embedded C code is called
\emph{Ivory}.  Ivory shares the goal of other ``safe-C'' standalone languages
and compilers like Cyclone~\cite{cyclone} and Rust~\cite{rust}.  Our main
motivation for not using these languages is to have the benefits of an EDSL and
particularly our desire for a convenient, Turing-complete, type-safe
macro-language (Haskell) to improve our productivity.

There have also been some ``safe-C'' EDSLs including Atom~\cite{atom},
Copilot~\cite{copilot}, and FeldSpar~\cite{feldspar1}.  The most significant
difference between these languages and Ivory is that they are focused on pure
computations and do not provide convenient support for defining in-memory
data-structures and manipulating memory.  Ivory is designed to be a
general-purpose embedded C EDSL that can be used for memory-manipulation
intensive programs, such as device drivers.

The essential contributions of Ivory from a programming language perspective are
its expressiveness and our approach to type-safety.

\paragraph{Expressiveness}
Regarding the expressiveness, Ivory has a variety of useful features, including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Memory-areas}: the ability to allocate stack-based memory and
    manipulate both local and global memory areas~\cite{memareas}.
  \item \emph{Product types}: C structs with well-typed accessors.
  \item \emph{FFI}: typed interfaces for calling arbitrary C functions.
  %% \item \emph{Module system}: managing dependencies to support C-level headers
  %%   and includes.
  \item \emph{Bit-fields}: support for typed manipulation of bit-fields and
    registers~\cite{high-level}.
\end{itemize}

We built Ivory with some limitations in order to  ensure safe C programs are
generated.  Ivory does not support heap-based dynamic memory allocation (but
global variables can be defined).  C arrays are fixed-length.  There is no
pointer arithmetic.  Pointers are non-nullable.  Union types are not supported.
Unsafe casts are not supported: casts must be to a strictly more expressive type
(e.g., from an unsigned 8-bit integer to an unsigned 16-bit integer) or a
default value must be provided for when the cast is not valid. The most common
unsafe C cast is not possible: no void-pointer type exists in Ivory.

In Ivory, these have not been limiting factors, particularly because of the
power of using Haskell as a macro system.  For example, while arrays must be of
fixed size at C compile-time, we can define a single \emph{Haskell} function
that is polymorphic in the array size that becomes instantiated at a particular
size at each use site.  %% An array has the type

%% \begin{code}
%% Array (n::Nat) t
%% \end{code}

\paragraph{Type-checking}
Ivory's domain-specific type checking focuses on guaranteeing memory
safety and helping programmers reason about their programs' nonfunctional
behaviors more easily.

%% Our claim is that for the fragment of C generated, these type checks are
%% sufficient to guarantee generated programs are memory safe (a forthcoming paper
%% will make this argument explicit).

%% With respect to memory safety, the essential
%% guarantees necessary, for our restricted form of C, are that
%% \begin{itemize}
%%   \item null pointers are never dereferenced;
%%   \item array indexing occurs only within the memory allocated to
%%     the array;
%%   \item no dangling pointers are possible; in particular, a function should not
%%     return a pointer to memory allocated within its own stack frame.
%% \end{itemize}

In addition, Ivory programs have an \emph{effects} type associated with them.
There are three kinds of effects tracked:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Allocation effects}: whether a program performs (stack-based)
    memory allocation as well as whether pointers point into global or stack memory.
  \item \emph{Return effects}: whether a program contains a \cd{return} statement.
  \item \emph{Break effects}: whether a program contains a \cd{break}
    statement.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Tracking allocation effects allows memory allocation to be restricted and
tracked.  Return and break statements fundamentally effect control-flow and can
result in unexpected behavior by breaking out of the current block or returning
from a function.  Such effects are particularly dangerous in the context of an
EDSL in which programs are generated and manipulated heavily in the host
language.  Combining allocation and return effects, the type system guarantees
that a pointer into the stack cannot be returned by a function (which is indeed
memory-unsafe).

In an EDSL, we have at least two options for type checking: (1) write a
domain-specific type-checker \emph{in} Haskell (relying on Haskell's type-system
just for macro-language type-checking), or (2) embed the domain-specific type
checker into Haskell's type system.

For a large system such as SMACCMPilot, the development times are substantial.
Therefore, our goal is to learn about program errors early, motivating us to
pursue option (2), to detect errors during type-checking, which is fast and
modular, rather than after Haskell compilation, when executing the EDSL programs
to generate C code.  (We discuss the issues of finding errors early on in more
detail in Section~\ref{sec:thegood}.)

Our hypothesis when developing Ivory was that recent type-system extensions to
the version of Haskell implemented by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler make it
feasible to embed the invariants necessary to ensure memory-safe C programming
into the type system~\cite{dephaskell}.  From a practical standpoint, doing so
demonstrates just how far the type-system has come, allowing us to replicate the
type safety of compilers like Cyclone, etc.

We do not have space to adequately describe Ivory's type system; we leave that
to a forthcoming paper.  Here we will note that the embedding depends on the use
of data kinds~\cite{datakinds}, type families~\cite{typefamilies}, and rank-2
polymorphism~\cite{stmonad}.

%% we define a type-level record to track effects.  We do not have
%% space to describe the full embedded type system, but hope to do so in a
%% forthcoming paper describing the Ivory language.


%% \paragraph{Effects}
%%   Using the data kind extension to lift data types to define kinds and
%% types, we define a kind \cd{RetEff} with the type \cd{Ret r} denoting that an
%% Ivory code block contains a return statement, and if so, the type of the value
%% returned.  If there is no return statement, the associated type is \cd{NoRet}.
%% We similarly define an allocation kind containing types that denote whether
%% there is local or global memory allocation as well as the type of the value
%% allocated.  Using type families, we define rewrite rules that are type-level
%% record selectors that take a type of kind \cd{Effects} and returns the field (a
%% type) of interest.

%% There is an additional effect tracking the use of
%% \cd{break} statements, which may optionally appear only inside loop bodies.
%% So, some combinators in Ivory can reset effects:
%% \cd{break} is not permitted in procedure bodies, but introducing a loop
%% combinator allows \cd{break} statements to be used in that body.

%% The approach of faking
%% type-level records allows us to encode an arbitrary number of effects in a
%% single type.


\paragraph{Programmer Interface}
Ivory has different ``inferfaces'' for writing programs, defining procedures to
encapsulate programs (and that are compiled to C functions), defining data
structures, and for constructing modules.  We cannot cover all of these here, so
we focus on the most central, explaining them by way of an example.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{smcode}
[ivory|
struct foo\_struct
  \{ bar :: Stored Uint8
  ; baz :: Array 10 (Stored Sint16)
  \}
|]

foo\_init :: Def(`[Ref s (Struct "foo\_struct")]:-> ())
foo\_init = proc "foo\_init" $ \textbackslash{}f\_ref -> body (prgm f\_ref)

prgm :: Ref s (Struct "foo_struct") -> Ivory eff ()
prgm f_ref = do
  store  (f_ref \(\sim\)> bar)      1
  store ((f_ref \(\sim\)> baz) ! 0) 2

foo\_module :: Module
foo\_module = package "foo\_module" $ do
  defStruct (Proxy :: Proxy "foo_struct")
  incl foo\_init
    \end{smcode}
  \caption{Example Ivory module definition}
  \label{fig:module}
\end{figure}
%% $

Consider Figure~\ref{fig:module}.  First, we define a struct (or product type)
using a quasiquoter.  Struct \cd{foo\_struct} contains two fields
consisting of an unsigned byte and an array of 10 signed 16-bit integers.  The
\cd{Stored} type constructor signifies that the value is allocated
in-memory~\cite{memareas}.  The \cd{Array} type constructor takes a type-level
natural number as a parameter (implemented as a Glasgow Haskell Compiler
extension) to fix the size of an array.

The quasiquoter uses Template Haskell~\cite{th} to generate
typeclass instances for the defined struct as well as top-level values that are
field accessors.  For example, for the \cd{bar} field, a label
\begin{code}
bar :: Label "foo\_struct" (Stored Uint8),
bar = Label "bar"
\end{code}
\noindent
is generated.  We describe the use of labels shortly.

A procedure, corresponding to a C function, has a type of the form
\cd{Def (params :-> out)}
where \cd{params} are the procedure's parameter types and \cd{out} is its return
type.  The procedure \cd{foo\_init} has a single input and its return type is
unit, corresponding to the \cd{void} type in C.  The types of the procedure's
inputs are types in a type-level list (the (\cd{`}) promotes the list value
constructor to a type constructor~\cite{datakinds}).  The type
\cd{Ref s area}
is the type of a \emph{reference}, or pointer guaranteed to be non-null by
construction.  A reference type constructor takes a \emph{scope} type and a
memory-area type.  The scope type denotes stack-allocated scope, or global and
statically allocated scope.  In the example, the parameter to \cd{foo\_init} can
be a reference to either scope.  The memory area pointed to be the reference
has the type of the struct defined above.

Now we describe the procedure \cd{foo\_init}.  The function \cd{proc} takes a
string corresponding to the name of the function that will be generated in C,
then a function from the procedures arguments to its body.  The lambda-bound
variable \cd{f\_ref}'s type is
\begin{code}
Ref s (Struct "foo\_struct")
\end{code}
\noindent
Before the body of a procedure, the user may add expression-level preconditions
on inputs and postconditions on return values. (These are not shown in the
current example).

The body of the procedure is defined by \cd{prgm}.  Its return type is an Ivory
expression, returning unit.  The Ivory monad also contains an effects parameter
that tracks effects, as described above, using a type-level record.

\newcommand{\mytilde}{\raise.17ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle\mathtt{\sim}$}}

Two statements implement the program, both of which update memory areas.  The
\cd{store} operator takes a reference and a value, and stores the value in the
the memory area pointed to by the reference.  The struct accessor operator,
reminiscent of C's \cd{->} operator, has the type
\begin{code}
(\(\sim\)>) :: Ref s (Struct symbol)
      -> Label symbol field -> Ref s field
\end{code}
\noindent
again eliding type class and data-kind constraints.  Note, however, that
gives \cd{\mytilde{}>} gives a reference to the field, not the field value.

The \cd{bar} field of the struct pointed to is updated with 1.  Updating
\cd{baz} is slightly more complicated since it contains an array. In
the example, the 0th index of the array in the \cd{baz} field is updated with 2
(the other indexes are unmodified).

Array indexing is guaranteed to be safe by the type system.  Like arrays,
indexes into arrays have types that are parameterized by a type-level natural
number.  An index type \cd{Ix n} only supports indexes from \cd{0} to \cd{n-1}.
Eliding type-class and data-kind constraints for the sake of presentation, the
type of the index operator ensures that the array length and index size match:
\begin{code}
(!) :: Ref s (Array len area) -> Ix len -> Ref s area
\end{code}

The final interface we describe in this example if our module interface.
A \cd{Module} contains all of the top-level procedures and struct definitions to
be sent to the compiler.  The module \cd{foo\_module} contains the definition
for the struct and the implementation of the function.  Because structure names
are type-level strings which are not \cd{*}-kinded, a proxy type is given to
turn an arbitrary-kinded type into a \cd{*}-kinded type (which can be passed to
a function). We discuss drawbacks of this module system design in
Section~\ref{sec:thegood}.

%% The basic syntax of Ivory is the statement, which make up all procedures.
%% Ivory statements are effectful, we used a traditional a monadic interface.
%% Internally, the Ivory monad is a writer transformer (to record
%% statements) over the state monad (to generate fresh names). As discussed above,
%% the Ivory monad type is parameterized by an effects to restrict effects in
%% statements. An example given in Figure~\ref{fig:tower-ex} is explained below.

%% \lp{TODO squigglies}



%% The module system was one major language feature Ivory could not inherit from
%% it's host language. Because Haskell does not have any mechanism for reflection
%% of module contents, the Ivory programmer must create modules explicitly.

%% In Ivory, procedures and global memory areas are ordinary Haskell values. These,
%% along with dependencies, type definitions, and foreign function headers, must be
%% listed as the contents of an Ivory module. We use a monadic interface for
%% building modules, but the only action supported by this \cd{ModuleM} monad
%% is writing: all values have type \cd{ModuleM ()}; essentially it is the same as
%% building a list, but with slightly more convenient syntax. The example module
%% in Figure~\ref{fig:module} shows a module \cd{foo\_module} which contains:
%% \begin{itemize}
%%   \item a type definition of \cd{Struct "foo"}, from Figure~\ref{fig:structqq}
%%   \item a function \cd{foo\_init}
%%   \item a global memory area \cd{foo\_global}.
%% \end{itemize}
%% \lp{TODO make sure lists and compact lists are the same}

%% Ivory modules are translated to C as a single module at a time. Due to this
%% restriction, the compiler cannot guarantee that each module fully describes all
%% of its type, function, \& memory area dependencies, because the compilation
%% cannot assume any knowledge of the contents of dependencies. This is for good
%% reason: since dependencies may be foreign (non-Ivory generated) header files,
%% they may not be possible to describe in the Ivory type system.

%% We did not pursue whole-program compilation, where an entire set of
%% interdependent modules could be checked against each other for consistency.
%% However, it is possible that changing our approach to the module system would
%% permit us to catch errors earlier without undue burden to the programmer. We
%% plan to investigate this problem further in the future.

%% \begin{code}
%% foo3 :: Def (`[Ref s (Array 10 (Stored Uint32))] :-> ())
%% foo3 = proc "foo" $ \textbackslash{}arr -> body $ do
%%   arrayMap $ \textbackslash{}ix -> do
%%     v <- deref (arr ! ix)
%%     store (arr ! ix) (v+1)
%% \end{code}
%% %% $


%% Memory-allocated types have a distinct kind.  The benefit of doing so is that
%% type classes with methods operating on memory areas are defined closed under .
%% The type of all data that can be allocated (either globally or locally) has kind
%% \cd{Area k}:
%% \begin{code}
%% data Area k
%%   = Array Nat (Area k)
%%   | Struct Symbol
%%   | ...
%% \end{code}
%% \noindent
%% We have elided a few additional memory area types.  Note to that the data type
%% is used only to define a kind and its types~\cite{}; we do not use \cd{Array},
%% etc. as value constructors.  The type constructor for an array type
%% takes a type-level natural number (from \cd{GHC.TypeLits}) representing its
%% length at the type-level and the type of the values contained in the array.
%% Similarly, the type constructor for a struct type takes a type-level string that
%% names the struct definition.
