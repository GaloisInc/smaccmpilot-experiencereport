\section{Ivory: Safe C Programming}

\begin{itemize}
\item Brief overview of Ivory.
\item Note that types are embedded in GHC type-checker.
\item Philosophy: push errors higher into the design cycle (C runtime to C
  compile time to DSL runtime to typechecking time).
\item Insert checks into compiler.  Easy with EDSL  (blog post).
\end{itemize}
