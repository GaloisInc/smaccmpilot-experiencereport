\section{Ivory: Safe C Programming}
\label{sec:ivory}

At face value, our approach sounds audacious if not ludicrous: faced with a
deadline for developing a new high-assurance autopilot system in one-and-a-half
years, start by designing a new programming language and compiler from the
ground up.

Of course, developing an EDSL is not the same as developing a stand-alone
compiler.  Much of the typical compiler tool-chain, such as the front-end
parser/lexer, is provided for free by the host language.  Furthermore, effort
to develop the EDSL compiler was low because Haskell is a great language for
building compilers, and has a rich set of existing libraries
%% (e.g., \cd{language-c-quote}~\cite{mainland-cquote})
which we built on top of. It took approximately 6 engineer-months to create the
Ivory language and compiler, which totals about 6k lines of Haskell code.

The language we developed for generating safe embedded C code is called
\emph{Ivory}.  Ivory shares the goal of other ``safe-C'' standalone languages
and compilers like Cyclone~\cite{cyclone} and Rust~\cite{rust}.  Our main
motivation for not using these languages is our desire for a convenient,
Turing-complete, type-safe macro-language (Haskell) to improve our productivity.

There have also been some ``safe-C'' EDSLs including Atom~\cite{atom},
Copilot~\cite{copilot}, and FeldSpar~\cite{feldspar1}.  The most significant
difference between these languages and Ivory is that they are focused on pure
computations and do not provide convenient support for defining in-memory
data-structures and manipulating memory.  Ivory is designed to be a
general-purpose EDSL that can be used for writing low-level C programs.

Ivory also makes interesting contributions from a programming language
perspective, namely in its expressiveness and type-safety.

\paragraph{Expressiveness}
Regarding the expressiveness, Ivory has a variety of useful features, including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Memory-areas}: the ability to allocate stack-based memory and
    manipulate both local and global memory areas~\cite{memareas}.
  \item \emph{Product types}: C structs with well-typed accessors.
  \item \emph{FFI}: typed interfaces for calling arbitrary C functions.
  %% \item \emph{Module system}: managing dependencies to support C-level headers
  %%   and includes.
  \item \emph{Bit-fields}: support for typed manipulation of bit-fields and
    registers~\cite{high-level}.
\end{itemize}

We built Ivory with some limitations in order to  ensure safe C programs are
generated.  Ivory does not support heap-based dynamic memory allocation (but
global variables can be defined).  C arrays are fixed-length.  There is no
pointer arithmetic.  Pointers are non-nullable.  Union types are not supported.
Unsafe casts are not supported: casts must be to a strictly more expressive type
(e.g., from an unsigned 8-bit integer to an unsigned 16-bit integer) or a
default value must be provided for when the cast is not valid. The most common
unsafe C cast is not possible: no void-pointer type exists in Ivory.

In Ivory, these have not been limiting factors, particularly because of the
power of using Haskell as a macro system.  For example, while arrays must be of
fixed size at C compile-time, we can define a single \emph{Haskell} function
that is polymorphic in the array size that becomes instantiated at a particular
size at each use site.  %% An array has the type

%% \begin{code}
%% Array (n::Nat) t
%% \end{code}

\paragraph{Type-checking}
Ivory's domain-specific type checking focuses on guaranteeing memory
safety and helping programmers reason about their programs' nonfunctional
behaviors more easily.

%% Our claim is that for the fragment of C generated, these type checks are
%% sufficient to guarantee generated programs are memory safe (a forthcoming paper
%% will make this argument explicit).

%% With respect to memory safety, the essential
%% guarantees necessary, for our restricted form of C, are that
%% \begin{itemize}
%%   \item null pointers are never dereferenced;
%%   \item array indexing occurs only within the memory allocated to
%%     the array;
%%   \item no dangling pointers are possible; in particular, a function should not
%%     return a pointer to memory allocated within its own stack frame.
%% \end{itemize}

In addition, Ivory programs have an \emph{effects} type associated with them.
There are three kinds of effects tracked:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Allocation effects}: whether a program performs (stack-based)
    memory allocation as well as whether pointers point into global or stack memory.
  \item \emph{Return effects}: whether a program contains a \cd{return} statement.
  \item \emph{Break effects}: whether a program contains a \cd{break}
    statement.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
Tracking allocation effects allows memory allocation to be restricted and
tracked.  Return and break statements fundamentally effect control-flow and can
result in unexpected behavior by breaking out of the current block or returning
from a function.  Such effects are particularly dangerous in the context of an
EDSL in which programs are generated and manipulated heavily in the host
language. By combining allocation and return effects, the type system guarantees
that a pointer into the stack cannot be returned by a function (which is indeed
memory-unsafe).

In an EDSL, we have at least two options for type checking: (1) write a
domain-specific type-checker \emph{in} Haskell (relying on Haskell's type-system
just for macro-language type-checking), or (2) embed the domain-specific type
checker into Haskell's type system.

We were motivated to pursue option (2) because it allows us to discover problems
sooner in the development cycle. In the case of option (1), we only find out
about problems in the program's AST during code generation. Option (2) ensures
that all macro and library code are typed correctly, independent of their use in
the generated code. We discuss the issues of finding errors early on in more
detail in Section~\ref{sec:thegood}.

When we began developing Ivory, our hypothesis  was that recent type-system
extensions to the Glasgow Haskell Compiler make it feasible to embed the
invariants necessary to ensure memory-safe C programming into the
type-system~\cite{dephaskell}. From a practical standpoint, Ivory demonstrates
just how far the type-system has come, allowing us to replicate the type safety
of compilers like Cyclone, etc.

We do not have space to adequately describe Ivory's type system; we leave that
to a forthcoming paper.  Here we will note that the embedding depends on the use
of data kinds~\cite{datakinds}, type families~\cite{typefamilies}, and rank-2
polymorphism~\cite{stmonad}.

%% we define a type-level record to track effects.  We do not have
%% space to describe the full embedded type system, but hope to do so in a
%% forthcoming paper describing the Ivory language.


%% \paragraph{Effects}
%%   Using the data kind extension to lift data types to define kinds and
%% types, we define a kind \cd{RetEff} with the type \cd{Ret r} denoting that an
%% Ivory code block contains a return statement, and if so, the type of the value
%% returned.  If there is no return statement, the associated type is \cd{NoRet}.
%% We similarly define an allocation kind containing types that denote whether
%% there is local or global memory allocation as well as the type of the value
%% allocated.  Using type families, we define rewrite rules that are type-level
%% record selectors that take a type of kind \cd{Effects} and returns the field (a
%% type) of interest.

%% There is an additional effect tracking the use of
%% \cd{break} statements, which may optionally appear only inside loop bodies.
%% So, some combinators in Ivory can reset effects:
%% \cd{break} is not permitted in procedure bodies, but introducing a loop
%% combinator allows \cd{break} statements to be used in that body.

%% The approach of faking
%% type-level records allows us to encode an arbitrary number of effects in a
%% single type.



%% The basic syntax of Ivory is the statement, which make up all procedures.
%% Ivory statements are effectful, we used a traditional a monadic interface.
%% Internally, the Ivory monad is a writer transformer (to record
%% statements) over the state monad (to generate fresh names). As discussed above,
%% the Ivory monad type is parameterized by an effects to restrict effects in
%% statements. An example given in Figure~\ref{fig:tower-ex} is explained below.

%% The module system was one major language feature Ivory could not inherit from
%% it's host language. Because Haskell does not have any mechanism for reflection
%% of module contents, the Ivory programmer must create modules explicitly.

%% In Ivory, procedures and global memory areas are ordinary Haskell values. These,
%% along with dependencies, type definitions, and foreign function headers, must be
%% listed as the contents of an Ivory module. We use a monadic interface for
%% building modules, but the only action supported by this \cd{ModuleM} monad
%% is writing: all values have type \cd{ModuleM ()}; essentially it is the same as
%% building a list, but with slightly more convenient syntax. The example module
%% in Figure~\ref{fig:module} shows a module \cd{foo\_module} which contains:
%% \begin{itemize}
%%   \item a type definition of \cd{Struct "foo"}, from Figure~\ref{fig:structqq}
%%   \item a function \cd{foo\_init}
%%   \item a global memory area \cd{foo\_global}.
%% \end{itemize}
%% \lp{TODO make sure lists and compact lists are the same}

%% Ivory modules are translated to C as a single module at a time. Due to this
%% restriction, the compiler cannot guarantee that each module fully describes all
%% of its type, function, \& memory area dependencies, because the compilation
%% cannot assume any knowledge of the contents of dependencies. This is for good
%% reason: since dependencies may be foreign (non-Ivory generated) header files,
%% they may not be possible to describe in the Ivory type system.

%% We did not pursue whole-program compilation, where an entire set of
%% interdependent modules could be checked against each other for consistency.
%% However, it is possible that changing our approach to the module system would
%% permit us to catch errors earlier without undue burden to the programmer. We
%% plan to investigate this problem further in the future.

%% \begin{code}
%% foo3 :: Def (`[Ref s (Array 10 (Stored Uint32))] :-> ())
%% foo3 = proc "foo" $ \textbackslash{}arr -> body $ do
%%   arrayMap $ \textbackslash{}ix -> do
%%     v <- deref (arr ! ix)
%%     store (arr ! ix) (v+1)
%% \end{code}
%% %% $


%% Memory-allocated types have a distinct kind.  The benefit of doing so is that
%% type classes with methods operating on memory areas are defined closed under .
%% The type of all data that can be allocated (either globally or locally) has kind
%% \cd{Area k}:
%% \begin{code}
%% data Area k
%%   = Array Nat (Area k)
%%   | Struct Symbol
%%   | ...
%% \end{code}
%% \noindent
%% We have elided a few additional memory area types.  Note to that the data type
%% is used only to define a kind and its types~\cite{}; we do not use \cd{Array},
%% etc. as value constructors.  The type constructor for an array type
%% takes a type-level natural number (from \cd{GHC.TypeLits}) representing its
%% length at the type-level and the type of the values contained in the array.
%% Similarly, the type constructor for a struct type takes a type-level string that
%% names the struct definition.
