\section{SMACCMPilot: a High-Assurance Autopilot}

\begin{itemize}
	\item what is smaccmpilot?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item flight control software for small quadcopters
			\item bare metal on a microcontroller based board
			\item responsible for reading sensors, computing control
				outputs, and writing outputs to motor
				controllers in real time, at 200hz
			\item encrypted link for command, control, and telemetry
		\end{itemize}
	\item size/complexity of system
		\begin{itemize}
			\item tower complexity
				\begin{itemize}
					\item tasks
					\item channels
					\item in many cases, we use more tasks
						than are strictly required,
						mostly because individual event
						loops \& channels are a nice
						method of building abstractions
				\end{itemize}
			\item haskell loc: 10kloc application code, 3kloc bsp,
				10kloc generated from MAVLink message schema (an
				IDL with standard binary representation)
			\item c loc: generates 48kloc, depend on external
				libraries for another 10kloc, + os
			\item comparison to existing systems
				\begin{itemize}
					\item apm project
						60kloc code, supports multiple
						platforms
					\item px4 project
						25kloc application code
						25kloc support code, + big os
					\item these support a higher amount of
						autonomy than smaccmpilot, but
						the basics - IO, sensor fusion,
						flight stabilizer, telemetry,
						command \& control, make up the
						majority of the code.
