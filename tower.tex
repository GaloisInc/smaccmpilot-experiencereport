\section{Tower: from Functions to Architectures}
\label{sec:tower}

In a typical embedded systems project, programmer must produce an entire
system of software that interacts with multiple input and output peripherals
concurrently using a real-time operating system (RTOS). Typical RTOSes provide
just a few low-level locking and signaling primitives for scheduling. Since
microcontrollers do not have virtual memory managment units (MMUs) found on
larger processors, the RTOS kernel can't protect the system against badly
behaved user code. These restrictions put significant burden on the programmer:
she must ensure all tasks and communication between tasks is implemented
correctly.

Luckily, we already have Ivory in our toolbox, which can provide lots of the
guarantees we need about task memory safety. To handle the rest of these
concerns, we have built Tower, an EDSL for specifying tasks and communication
channels that generates correct Ivory implementations, as well as architecture
description artifacts.

Tower's code generation approach offers safety guarantees because it does not
expose the dangerous low-level scheduling primitives to the user, and it keeps
type information for channels (i.e. the datatype of the channel message),
expressed as Ivory types, in the Haskell type system.

Tower allows the programmer to describe a static graph of channels and tasks.
This is a restriction of the capabilties of most operating systems, which may
create and destroy tasks or communication datastructures at run-time. However,
for the intended use case in high assurance systems, a static configuration of
channels and tasks makes it easier to reason about memory requirements, and
permits the system to be analyzed for schedulability.

\paragraph{Multiple Interpreters}
In the Tower frontend, the programmer specifies a system that can be turned into
multiple artifacts, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:towerArtifacts}.

Tower is designed to support different operating systems via a swappable
backend. Since all code that touches operating system primitives is generated by
Tower, it is trivial for the user to specify a system and compile it for
different operating systems. Tower supports both the open-soure
FreeRTOS~\cite{freertos} as well as the formally-verified eChronos
RTOS~\cite{echronos} development by NICTA.

The static tower graph of channels and tasks also makes it possible to
describe the system architecture to external tools. Tower has a backend which
generates a system description in the Architecture Analysis and Design Language
(AADL)~\cite{SAE:AADL}. We also built a backend for the Graphviz dot language.
These output formats make it possible to visualize, analyze, and automatically
check properties about the system, without knowing anything about Haskell,
Ivory, or Tower. This is an important feature when working with teams that may
not all be literate in Ivory/Tower.
